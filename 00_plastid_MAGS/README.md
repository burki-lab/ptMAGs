# Annotating plastid MAGs and getting their closest references

In this directory we carry out the following analyses:

1. Annotate the ptMAGs with MFANNOT. This is done in `results/01_ptMAGS.ipynb`.
2. Get reference sequences that will be used in downstream phylogenetic analyses. This is done in `results/02_references.ipynb`.
3. Comnpare the ptMAGs and references. This is done in `results/03_overview.ipynb`.
